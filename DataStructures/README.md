## Reverse a Linked List
### Problem Statement
You are given the head of a singly linked list. Your task is to reverse the list and return the reversed list.
### Solution
In the iterative approach, two pointers, prev and current, are initialized. The loop traverses the original linked list, reversing the links between nodes. After the loop, the prev pointer becomes the new head of the reversed list. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1), utilizing a constant amount of extra space for pointers.

## Detect Cycle in a Linked List 
### Problem Statement
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
### Solution
To identify cycles in a linked list efficiently, a specialized class is implemented with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1). The algorithm employs a two-pointer system, where a slow pointer and a fast pointer traverse the list. If they meet, a cycle is present; otherwise, a false value is returned. The algorithm's time complexity is determined by a while loop that traverses the linked list, iterating through all nodes at most twice. The space complexity is O(1), utilizing only a constant number of pointers and integer variables. Overall, this algorithm is well-suited for detecting cycles in a linked list with optimal efficiency.

## Container With Most Water 

### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Your task is to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container, such that the container contains the most water. You need to return the maximum amount of water that the container can store.

### Solution
The C++ function maxArea employs a two-pointer approach on a vector of integers to efficiently find the maximum water container area. It iterates through the vector, calculating container height and width, updating maxArea accordingly, and adjusting pointers until convergence. The time complexity is O(n), and space complexity is O(1). This solution provides an optimal method for the task.

## Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
### Problem Statement
Suppose you have an array of unique elements that is sorted in ascending order but has been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums might look like:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
You need to find and return the minimum element in this rotated array.

### Solution 
The algorithm efficiently finds the minimum element in a rotated or sorted array using binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1). It initializes pointers, updates results based on sorted subarrays, and adjusts pointers to locate the minimum value. This approach consistently utilizes a minimal amount of extra space, making it effective for diverse array sizes.



## Longest Repeating Character Replacement 

### Problem Statement
You are given a string s consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer k. You can choose any character within the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You are allowed to perform this operation at most k times.

Your task is to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing the specified character replacements.

### Solution
To address the problem, utilize a sliding window approach with an array named "count" to track character occurrences. Maintain variables for "maxCount," "start," and "maxLength." Iterate through the string, updating counts and adjusting the window as needed. Return the final "maxLength." The time complexity is O(N), and the space complexity is O(1), as the array size remains constant.



## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
### Problem Description
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Solution
The C++ solution employs a sliding window technique to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string 's'. Two pointers, 'left' and 'right', manage the window, while a set, 'charSet', tracks unique characters. The algorithm iterates through the string, expanding and contracting the window as needed. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the string length, and the space complexity is O(min(n, m)), with m being the character set size. In practical terms, for a reasonably small character set, the space complexity is effectively O(1).
