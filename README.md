# LeetCode
This repository contains solutions for coding problems.

## Contains Duplicate
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, determine if any value appears at least twice in the array, returning true if duplicates exist and false if all elements are distinct.

### Example
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

### Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

### Solution
The provided C++ code defines a Solution class with a function containsDuplicate that checks for duplicates in the input array using an unordered map to store the count of each element. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n).

## Two Sum

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find two numbers in the array that sum up to the target and return their indices. Assume that there is exactly one solution and the same element is not used twice.

### Example
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

### Constraints
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109

### Solution
The provided C++ code defines a Solution class with a function twoSum that uses a hash map to store previously seen numbers and their indices. The algorithm achieves O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.
